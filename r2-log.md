# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - nemogoc

This is the log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on Feb 18, Sunday, 2018. Objective is to complete Udemy's Web dev bootcamp, then either start the advanced bootcamp or work on projects. I did not start daily logging until Mar 11th. Prior to that is reconstructed from notes.

## Log

### R2D1 - 2/18
Completed Sections 1 & 2 - Intro to course & Front end dev. Decided to go through review material even though it isn't new. I always pick up something new, especially in CSS.

### R2D2 - 2/19
Vacation day from work - completed sections 3 & 4 - HTML. Not much new material here, but tons of IDE tips.

### R2D3 - 2/20
Really enjoying this - completed section 5 - CSS. Always good to hit this stuff again.

### R2D4 - 2/22
Completed section 6 - Intermediate CSS. Alignment, responsive work. I do feel like the 10000th time is the charm when learning this. 

### R2D5 - 2/23
Worked on section 7 - Bootstrap. Forms/Nav. 

### R2D6 - 2/24
Worked on section 7 - Bootstrap. Grid system. I realize this isn't used as much as it used to be, but it does seem really nice.

### R2D7 - 2/25
Finished up section 7 - Bootstrap. Image gallery/Font-awesome/Startup landing page. Not sure I love this codealong system. I still learn plenty, but it is very passive. Some good CSS tips in the Bootstrap section of my notes

### R2D8 - 2/26
Completed section 8 - Javascript. Mostly review, but some good edge case notes (e.g. no error for passing 2 args to a 3 arg function)

### R2D9 - 2/27
Work from home day with nothing to do. Completed Sections 9, 10, & 11 - Javascript Control Flow, Functions, & Arrays. Still mostly review, but good clarification on forEach implicit arg passing. For the first time I am not completely confused about that.

### R2D10 - 3/1
Completed section 12 - Javascript Objects. Still really enjoying the style of this, but ready to get past review now. Read a good suggestion to deal with codealongs (may be obvious, but I didn't think of it). After he says what we're going to do, pause video and attempt it before he gives any tech details, then compare answers.

### R2D11 - 3/2
Completed section 13 - DOM Manipulation. Selectors are easy, thanks to QA.

### R2D12 - 3/3
Completed section 14 - Advanced DOM Manipulation. Had some trouble with Score Keeper exercise. I was trying to keep state by updating the HTML with JS, then reading back the HTML to JS. His solution just kept state in JS. A lot better.

### R2D13 - 3/4
Completed section 15 - Color Game Project. Was able to do large swathes of the project in between watching video. As usual, only major difficulty was CSS, although I tend to use more divs.

### R2D14 - 3/5
Completed section 16 & 17 - Intro to jQuery & Advanced jQuery. Was skeptical of the need for jQuery, given that document API seemed pretty easy to use. Definitely saw some benefits doing this, but also understand why use is dropping.

### R2D15 - 3/7
Squeezed this in, worked on section 18 - Todo List Projects. Went fine, but short on time. Really looking forward to starting on back end.

### R2D16 - 3/8
Powered through 18 & finished the project. Watched 19 and took notes, but was VERY ready to move on to back end, so didn't complete the coding myself, just watched along. Maybe something to swing back to when finished, but I feel like I got the important information from it. 

### R2D17 - 3/9
Watched sections 20 & 21 (Backend basics & Command Line) on 2x since they were complete review. Quickly went through Section 22 as well (Node JS). Didn't realize Node was just a way to run JS on a server, shows how naive I was about all this. Burnt through the exercises though, since installing packages & coding JS was pretty easy.

### R2D18 - 3/10
Completed section 23 & 24 (Server Side Frameworks & Intermediate Express). Following easily, but learning a ton. Started section 25 (Working with APIs).

### R2D19 - 3/11
Shorter time today, but still managed to complete section 25 & do the initial routes for YelpCamp (start of section 26). Decided to formally log the 100 days challenge again.

-------------------------------------------------------

### R2D20 - 3/12
06:50: Worked for about 30 minutes in the morning to implement adding new campgrounds to YC. Learning REST implementation.
Intended to get back to do remaining 30, but ended up not being possible.

### R2D21 - 3/13
Worked through initial yelpcamp styling (end of section 26). Definitely feeling like the quality of TWDBC is slipping a bit. A lot more rushed implementations and bad edits. Hoping starting a more concrete topic like databases (section 27) will reground. Still like Bootstrap's grid system, but can't get excited about learning about it, and styling since I know it is fading. I think CSS Flexbox is a replacement, and I'm eager to get to that.

### R2D22 - 3/14
10:00 - Installed Mongo & finished section 27. Database & Authentication (section 32) are the last 2 things I'm really excited to learn with this course, so nice to get 1 of those started (more db stuff in the sections to come). I will probably put more time in later, but definitely hit the minimum so far.
16:15 - Added mongo to yelpcamp. Went really well, paused video before he did it, and it all worked great. He suggested 1 minor change, but my way wasn't wrong. Learned first four RESTful routes and implemented them.

### R2D23 - 3/15
19:00 Talked about all 7 RESTful routes & started the blog site that demonstrates them.

### R2D24 - 3/16
16:00 Was able to complete the first 3 routes without any codealong, albeit unstyled. Definitely feel like I have the basics of routes down pat.

### R2D25 - 3/17
Styled first 3 routes (codealong semantic UI) and added show route, with styling.

### R2D26 - 3/18
Finished remaining 3 routes.

### R2D27 - 3/20
Very sick the last few days. Couldn't do anything yesterday, so forced myself to do section 30 today - DB Associations & Module.exports. 

### R2D28 - 3/21
Started YelpCamp comment model stuff. Still pretty slow/low energy, but no difficulty learning.

### R2D29 - 3/22
Added comments to show page

### R2D30 - 3/24
Added the ability to add new comments. This was more or less the same as the other routes, but nested. We did refactor the routes to their own files though. Also styled the show page. Definitely styling is the weakest link of this class, imo. Lots of following along without much context.

### R2D31 - 3/25
Completed Section 32, Authentication. Definitely an interesting section, seems pretty easy to implement (using libraries, obviously). Discussed middleware too. I sort of knew what that was, but I feel much better in my understanding now. Will start section 33 to add auth to YC, but not expecting to get far today.
Later: Ended up completing section 33 as well, adding auth to yelpcamp. Fixed up my auth notes a bit, but since we're delegating most of auth, it came together pretty easily.

### R2D32 - 3/27
Completed section 34, which added user association to comments and campgrounds. Only a 3 video section, so I expected it to be quick, but they were longer more involved videos, so took a little bit. Definitely on the home stretch here, would like to be done by next week, but the last section is huge, so we'll see.

### R2D33 - 3/28
Completed section 35 to edit/delete campgrounds and comments. Going a bit more into middleware, which is nice. At this point, most things seem to be more putting things I know together (along with a few new methods) rather than whole new concepts, but we'll see if that holds going forward.

### R2D34 - 3/29
Completed sections 36 and 37. 36 added flash/lightbox messages, which was nice. Feels like the app is coming together. Also restyled the landing page. Skipped doing the dynamic pricing, since it was just another entry in the model, nothing new. 37 was git, which I knew already and watched 2x.
Started Section 38, Heroku deploy. Basically just running through the Heroku setup docs, so not a ton of new info there. Down to Env Vars, which will be useful, and then advanced JS in section 39, then done!

### R2D35 - 3/30
Completed env var & section 39. 39 was taught by Elie, who is one of the new instructors from the advanced class. Really liked his teaching style. Very careful with his language selection, and throrough. Explained `this` in a way that illuminated the weirdness of it to me.

### R2D36 - 3/31
Started Bootstrap 4 class, but it was written for the alpha. Apparently, stable syntax is very different. They claim they will be updating it shortly, so I'm going to skip it for now. Starting on AWDBC, with animations, which I realize are important, but I'm not excited by.

### R2D37 - 4/2
Worked through more of CSS animations. Also found a better bootstrap 4 class.

### R2D38 - 4/4
Added all projects from TWDBC to github and did the very beginning of animated gallery project.

### R2D39 - 4/8
Skipped a few days due to travelling and just needing a quick break. Excited to start back up. Built an animated gallery to demo transitions. Simple project, but cool how dramatically some simple animations change a page.

### R2D40 - 4/9
Worked on keyframe animation section. Animations are definitely cool, but this still feels premature to be learning. It feels like end of project polish, and I still have plenty of questions about making the project in the first place.

### R2D41 - 4/12
Did Sunrise animation, which I really enjoyed. I guess I was just sick hearing about animations, and I wanted to get down to it. Just the loading animation to go, then Flexbox, which I'm really looking forward to.

### R2D42 - 4/14
Did animation shorthand and loader project. Enjoyed it, but the things I learned were other CSS stuff, not animation stuff

### R2D43 - 4/15
Did a bunch of the Flexbox section. Seems useful, but I was equating Flexbox with Grid, and they're different things. I was excited about grid, and it doesn't look like we're going to cover that here. Flexbox is interesting and should be useful though.

### R2D44 - 4/18
Finished Flexbox section and did the 2 projects.
The Polygon.com widget helped demo the point of Flexbox. The fact that it was responsive without mediaqueries opened my eyes to some uses of this.
The Holy Grail layout came together quickly. I still have some issues choosing (and am somewhat confused on) how to use nested flexbox containers. The way I did it worked, but it was a bit hacky. He had the entire layout be a column flex container. I just used rows with wrapping and forced the containers to be 100% of width.
Lastly, started the startup site with Tim. Not a fan of Tim so far. As with the optional Tapatalk (or whatever) project in TWDBC Section 19, we used a bunch of CSS without going over it beforehand. Definitely a bit frustrating that we use Flexbox, then a bunch of relative and absolute positioning. Is that how it has to be done? 

### R2D45 - 4/19
Finished the startup site. Can't say I learned a ton. Matt is not good at this. It was a demo of a project, not teaching a project. Still, the next section has a new guy who seems better so far, but I did just start.

### R2D46 - 4/20
New guy Tim is better. Really enjoyed his talk about the call stack and event queue, although I did have to watch another video (great stuff: youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ) to really get a handle on it. Very surprising that JS has no interrupts for items on the event queue, but I guess you can avoid blocking.

### R2D47 - 4/21
Worked on AJAX with XHR. syntax is busy, but not difficult. Important for consuming APIs. Definitely thinking I have the tools to begin a real project here.

### R2D48 - 4/22-4/23
Started fetch options, but ran out of time before a full hour. Started back up 4/23 and finished fetch, including the projects on the end, then started the next section.

### R2D49 - 4/25
Did jQuery/Axios AJAX section. Really enjoyed it. Just like with the last section, I felt like I was doing something that I will use a ton.

### R2D50 - 4/26
Finished the Jasmine testing section. A little disappointed with Elie, who I was really impressed with before, but I felt that he didn't do a good enough job of laying out what he was teaching, then teaching it, then summarizing. I always felt like we were in the middle of a lesson of something that was introduced prior. The section felt like an afterthought also, although the intro to the next section says we'll be using it again, so maybe that'll improve. 

### R2D51 - 4/27
Did a bit over half of the array method section -- forEach, map, filter -- and their accompanying exercises. This is clearly Elie's strength, as he was much clearer here (gives me a little hope for Tim in the d3 section). The exercises really helped too. I know I have a hard time thinking to use these methods when solving problems, so doing the exercises helped remind me where they're useful. I'm sure that'll still be a challenge though.

### R2D52 - 4/30
Did the rest of the array method section. I was really unhappy with my reduce exercises, but I only did one small thing differently than the solution video. I still think there's a better way, but that really helped my confidence.
The next 3 sections will be review. I think the next 2 are exact copies of sections from TWDBC, and the 3rd is a quick run through express and node, so they should go quick. I'm not going to skip them though, just in case there's something new, but I imagine I'll be running them at 2x.

### R2D53 - 5/1
Glad I didn't skip through these sections. The videos themselves are mostly the same, but the exercises are really tough. Working on those today.

### R2D54 - 5/3
Ended up giving up on most of the Bind/Apply/Call exercises. Even the solution video was tough. Hoping examples of them in the wild will help, but I was getting bogged down with them, so I moved on.
The next section was mostly review of JS OOP, with a few new things around prototypal inheritance. Finished that section. Next is express, which should mostly be review.

### R2D55 - 5/4
Blew through the express/node/mongoose section. Vast majority was review.

#### GOING ON VACATION FOR 10 DAYS, PAUSING UNTIL I'M BACK
