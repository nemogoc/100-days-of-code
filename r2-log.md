# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - nemogoc

This is the log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on Feb 18, Sunday, 2018. Objective is to complete Udemy's Web dev bootcamp, then either start the advanced bootcamp or work on projects. I did not start daily logging until Mar 11th. Prior to that is reconstructed from notes.

## Log

### R2D1 - 2/18
Completed Sections 1 & 2 - Intro to course & Front end dev. Decided to go through review material even though it isn't new. I always pick up something new, especially in CSS.

### R2D2 - 2/19
Vacation day from work - completed sections 3 & 4 - HTML. Not much new material here, but tons of IDE tips.

### R2D3 - 2/20
Really enjoying this - completed section 5 - CSS. Always good to hit this stuff again.

### R2D4 - 2/22
Completed section 6 - Intermediate CSS. Alignment, responsive work. I do feel like the 10000th time is the charm when learning this. 

### R2D5 - 2/23
Worked on section 7 - Bootstrap. Forms/Nav. 

### R2D6 - 2/24
Worked on section 7 - Bootstrap. Grid system. I realize this isn't used as much as it used to be, but it does seem really nice.

### R2D7 - 2/25
Finished up section 7 - Bootstrap. Image gallery/Font-awesome/Startup landing page. Not sure I love this codealong system. I still learn plenty, but it is very passive. Some good CSS tips in the Bootstrap section of my notes

### R2D8 - 2/26
Completed section 8 - Javascript. Mostly review, but some good edge case notes (e.g. no error for passing 2 args to a 3 arg function)

### R2D9 - 2/27
Work from home day with nothing to do. Completed Sections 9, 10, & 11 - Javascript Control Flow, Functions, & Arrays. Still mostly review, but good clarification on forEach implicit arg passing. For the first time I am not completely confused about that.

### R2D10 - 3/1
Completed section 12 - Javascript Objects. Still really enjoying the style of this, but ready to get past review now. Read a good suggestion to deal with codealongs (may be obvious, but I didn't think of it). After he says what we're going to do, pause video and attempt it before he gives any tech details, then compare answers.

### R2D11 - 3/2
Completed section 13 - DOM Manipulation. Selectors are easy, thanks to QA.

### R2D12 - 3/3
Completed section 14 - Advanced DOM Manipulation. Had some trouble with Score Keeper exercise. I was trying to keep state by updating the HTML with JS, then reading back the HTML to JS. His solution just kept state in JS. A lot better.

### R2D13 - 3/4
Completed section 15 - Color Game Project. Was able to do large swathes of the project in between watching video. As usual, only major difficulty was CSS, although I tend to use more divs.

### R2D14 - 3/5
Completed section 16 & 17 - Intro to jQuery & Advanced jQuery. Was skeptical of the need for jQuery, given that document API seemed pretty easy to use. Definitely saw some benefits doing this, but also understand why use is dropping.

### R2D15 - 3/7
Squeezed this in, worked on section 18 - Todo List Projects. Went fine, but short on time. Really looking forward to starting on back end.

### R2D16 - 3/8
Powered through 18 & finished the project. Watched 19 and took notes, but was VERY ready to move on to back end, so didn't complete the coding myself, just watched along. Maybe something to swing back to when finished, but I feel like I got the important information from it. 

### R2D17 - 3/9
Watched sections 20 & 21 (Backend basics & Command Line) on 2x since they were complete review. Quickly went through Section 22 as well (Node JS). Didn't realize Node was just a way to run JS on a server, shows how naive I was about all this. Burnt through the exercises though, since installing packages & coding JS was pretty easy.

### R2D18 - 3/10
Completed section 23 & 24 (Server Side Frameworks & Intermediate Express). Following easily, but learning a ton. Started section 25 (Working with APIs).

### R2D19 - 3/11
Shorter time today, but still managed to complete section 25 & do the initial routes for YelpCamp (start of section 26). Decided to formally log the 100 days challenge again.

-------------------------------------------------------

### R2D20 - 3/12
06:50: Worked for about 30 minutes in the morning to implement adding new campgrounds to YC. Learning REST implementation.
Intended to get back to do remaining 30, but ended up not being possible.

### R2D21 - 3/13
Worked through initial yelpcamp styling (end of section 26). Definitely feeling like the quality of TWDBC is slipping a bit. A lot more rushed implementations and bad edits. Hoping starting a more concrete topic like databases (section 27) will reground. Still like Bootstrap's grid system, but can't get excited about learning about it, and styling since I know it is fading. I think CSS Flexbox is a replacement, and I'm eager to get to that.

### R2D22 - 3/14
10:00 - Installed Mongo & finished section 27. Database & Authentication (section 32) are the last 2 things I'm really excited to learn with this course, so nice to get 1 of those started (more db stuff in the sections to come). I will probably put more time in later, but definitely hit the minimum so far.
16:15 - Added mongo to yelpcamp. Went really well, paused video before he did it, and it all worked great. He suggested 1 minor change, but my way wasn't wrong. Learned first four RESTful routes and implemented them.

### R2D23 - 3/15
19:00 Talked about all 7 RESTful routes & started the blog site that demonstrates them.

### R2D24 - 3/16
16:00 Was able to complete the first 3 routes without any codealong, albeit unstyled. Definitely feel like I have the basics of routes down pat.
