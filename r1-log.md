## Log

### R1D1 - 9/28
Started at 4:30: Worked on applied visual design section of FCC beta front end cert. Definitely feeling ready to start some challenges despite FCC estimating I'm ~15h away from starting work on them. Starting with the non-beta stuff, then transitioning to beta probably didn't help this feeling. That said, this whole visual design section beefed up an area that felt light in the non-beta.

### R1D2 - 9/29
6:45: Started accessibility section later last night, after I had already submitted the note. The 5 hours estimated for this section seems like a placeholder. I put maybe 45 minutes in yesterday, and was able to finish it in an hour or so today. Turns out I'm closer to the projects than I thought in yesterday's entry! Accessibility stuff was really interesting, and there was also useful info about audio playback controls, keyboard shortcuts, and tabbing.
