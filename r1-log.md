# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - nemogoc

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on Sept 28, Thursday, 2017. Failed due to buying house and moving, followed by holidays.

## Log

### R1D1 - 9/28
Started at 16:30: Worked on applied visual design section of FCC beta front end cert. Definitely feeling ready to start some challenges despite FCC estimating I'm ~15h away from starting work on them. Starting with the non-beta stuff, then transitioning to beta probably didn't help this feeling. That said, this whole visual design section beefed up an area that felt light in the non-beta.

### R1D2 - 9/29
18:45: Started accessibility section later last night, after I had already submitted the note. The 5 hours estimated for this section seems like a placeholder. I put maybe 45 minutes in yesterday, and was able to finish it in an hour or so today. Turns out I'm closer to the projects than I thought in yesterday's entry! Accessibility stuff was really interesting, and there was also useful info about audio playback controls, keyboard shortcuts, and tabbing.

192.2

### R1D3 - 9/30
9:30: Started and finished Responsive Web Design Principles. Seems clear they're relying on frameworks or some other later lesson to really get in depth on it, since this section took maybe 20 minutes. Helpful stuff about scaling based on viewport size though. Starting Flexbox section, which may actually take a few hours. Or at least an hour. Maybe. justify-content seems useful.

189.4

### R1D4 - 10/1
20:20: Finished CSS Flexbox lessons. Tons of useful alignment, wrapping, and responsive stuff there. On to the projects, but that seems like a good stopping point for tonight. Did sign up for CodePen, though I may want to use WebStorm.. Also set up SSH key for github

189.6

### R1D5 - 10/2
17:25: Starting Tribute project, in codepen for now. Passed all tests, with some layout and CSS tweaks still needed to move on. Submitted it to FCC as is, will finish tomorrow.

188.4 Failed. Next failure 10/16

### R1D6 - 10/3
19:50: Finished Tribute project and exported from CodePen to GitHub. Set up WebStorm.
Maybe do http://learnlayout.com/index.html tomorrow?

190.2

### R1D7 - 10/4
20:00 Working through learnlayout.com to review/supplement FCC layout info. Might be older info, but good review of the basics.

XXX.X <-- life insurance exam today, 191.2

### R1D8 - 10/5
07:00 Finished learnlayout.com in 20 minutes or so. Lots of detail about flex layouts, seems useful.
19:30 Started Survey Form project. I was able to get all the test passing, but this reminded me I skipped the forms section on beta FCC, so I need to go back and take notes on that. Maybe tomorrow?

188.8

11:00 Reviewed form sections on FCC and took notes.
14:00 CSS work on survey project

189.2

### R1D10 - 10/7
08:00 CSS work on survey project.
17:00 Finished CSS work on survey project. Stole pretty button/dropdown/form CSS from example. Centered layout using margin: 0 auto; and made 2 row table (label    item) using display: inline-block.

187.8 (10am)

### R1D11 - 10/8
11:30 Started work on product landing page. Got the fontawesome icon/text pack, which was helpful. Passed 11/16 tests
19:15 Resumed work, got all the content tests passing, just need the layout tests (plus all the CSS).

187.4 (9am)

### R1D12 - 10/9
16:00 Having some issues with the CSS on the navbar on the product landing page.

### R1D13 - 10/10
19:50 Adding a mediaquery to page. All tests pass. Need to mix things up a bit, so starting the simple JS lessons.

185.6

### R1D14 - 10/11
20:45 Continued JS lessons. Didn't do full hour. Counting it for now, but I don't want to make a habit of it.

185.8

### R1D15 - 10/12
16:45 Continued JS lessons. Still working through the easy ones.

185.8

### R1D16 - 10/13
20:00 Basic JS is wearing on me. I think I'm 1 hour or so away from done. 

185.6

### R1D17 - 10/21
Skipped a bunch of days. This is technically against the rules for 100doc, but I'm going to keep going. I could say buying a house is my excuse, and that'd be sort of true, but it wasn't the whole story. Anyway...
08:00 Finishing up Basic JS. Today, I learned about accessing object properties using array notation, which allows someone to iterate over properties of an object (create an array with all the names of the props, then loop object[objNamesArray[i]]). It also lets you access a property at runtime when you don't know which at compile time. I've ran in to needing to do this before, so it's cool I have a way now.

185.4

### R1D18 - 10/23
I was away from home and actively busy for 18 hours yesterday, but this is becoming 100 days of excuses. Back to it. Every day when moving is busy, I need to make time for this.

14:30 Objects in JS. Actually some lessons where I have to put some thought in, which is fun.
