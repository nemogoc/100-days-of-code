# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - nemogoc

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on Sept 28, Thursday, 2017.

## Log

### R1D1 
Started at 4:30: Worked on applied visual design section of FCC beta front end cert. Definitely feeling ready to start some challenges despite FCC estimating I'm ~15h away from starting work on them. Starting with the non-beta stuff, then transitioning to beta probably didn't help this feeling. That said, this whole visual design section beefed up an area that felt light in the non-beta.

### R1D2
Started accessibility section. The 5 hours estimated seems like a placeholder, so I'm closer to the project than expected, which is good.
