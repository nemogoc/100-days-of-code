# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - nemogoc

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on Sept 28, Thursday, 2017.

## Log

### R1D1 - 9/28
Started at 16:30: Worked on applied visual design section of FCC beta front end cert. Definitely feeling ready to start some challenges despite FCC estimating I'm ~15h away from starting work on them. Starting with the non-beta stuff, then transitioning to beta probably didn't help this feeling. That said, this whole visual design section beefed up an area that felt light in the non-beta.

192.4

### R1D2 - 9/29
18:45: Started accessibility section later last night, after I had already submitted the note. The 5 hours estimated for this section seems like a placeholder. I put maybe 45 minutes in yesterday, and was able to finish it in an hour or so today. Turns out I'm closer to the projects than I thought in yesterday's entry! Accessibility stuff was really interesting, and there was also useful info about audio playback controls, keyboard shortcuts, and tabbing.

192.2

### R1D3 - 9/30
9:30: Started and finished Responsive Web Design Principles. Seems clear they're relying on frameworks or some other later lesson to really get in depth on it, since this section took maybe 20 minutes. Helpful stuff about scaling based on viewport size though. Starting Flexbox section, which may actually take a few hours. Or at least an hour. Maybe. justify-content seems useful.

189.4

### R1D4 - 10/1
20:20: Finished CSS Flexbox lessons. Tons of useful alignment, wrapping, and responsive stuff there. On to the projects, but that seems like a good stopping point for tonight. Did sign up for CodePen, though I may want to use WebStorm.. Also set up SSH key for github

189.6

### R1D5 - 10/2
17:25: Starting Tribute project, in codepen for now. Passed all tests, with some layout and CSS tweaks still needed to move on. Submitted it to FCC as is, will finish tomorrow.

188.4 Failed. Next failure 10/16

### R1D6 - 10/3
19:50: Finished Tribute project and exported from CodePen to GitHub. Set up WebStorm.
Maybe do http://learnlayout.com/index.html tomorrow?

190.2

### R1D7 - 10/4
20:00 Working through learnlayout.com to review/supplement FCC layout info. Might be older info, but good review of the basics.

XXX.X <-- life insurance exam today, 191.2

### R1D8 - 10/5
07:00 Finished learnlayout.com in 20 minutes or so. Lots of detail about flex layouts, seems useful.
19:30 Started Survey Form project. I was able to get all the test passing, but this reminded me I skipped the forms section on beta FCC, so I need to go back and take notes on that. Maybe tomorrow?
